1. Write a method that takes a linked list of ints and converts it into a linked list of words, with the word equivalent of the number i.e. 3, should be stored as “three” in the linked-list, 4 as “four”, and so on and so forth.
 
 
2. Suppose the strings "A"..."Z" are pushed onto a stack. Then they are popped off the stack and pushed onto a second stack. Finally, they are all popped off the second stack and printed. In which order are the strings printed?


5. Write java methods that Computes the products of all nodes in a BST (assuming that only integers are stored). What is the time complexity of the methods you have written? Why?
